  <h2>ARIA &amp; WebDriver</h2>

  <aside class="notes">
    <a href="https://w3c.github.io/aria/">WAI-ARIA</a> and <a
        href="https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/">WebDriver</a> are distinct web
    standards with highly similar goals: they both aim to enable
    machine-mediated interaction with web pages. In the case of ARIA, the
    machine is some Assistive Technology (e.g. a screen reader or a braille
    display), and it enables a person with a disability to effectively browse
    the web. In the case of WebDriver, the machine is a script written by a web
    developer, and it enables the developer to verify the correctness of their
    work.

  <aside class="notes">
    The differences in the paths used by developers and users to access web
    applications cause a number of problems. Web developers have little insight
    into the correctness of their application from the perspective of a visitor
    using Assistive Technology. Additionally there is information in the accessibility
    tree that more faithfully represents objects that the user would interact with.
    Web developers are today recreating that same information when writing tests without
    utilizing the a11y tree.

    WebDriver could be extended to interact through the accessibility tree.
    This way the web developer using WebDriver and the user using assistive
    technology both use the same path for a particular thing.

  <aside class="notes">
    <p>Developers who are familiar with best practices need to maintain even
    more code to operate on accessibility primitives using WebDriver's
    low-level API.</p>

    <p>Today, developers frequently encapsulate code like this using a
    pattern called "<a
    href="http://elementalselenium.com/tips/7-use-a-page-object">page
    objects</a>". This reduces maintenance costs to some extent, but it does
    not eliminate them.</p>

    <p>A single WebDriver command like "Set Radio" would reduce the amount of
    code developers have to maintain, and and it would make tests more
    declarative. For applications which are composed of conventional widgets,
    ARIA-aware WebDriver commands could remove the need for this practice.</p>

    const opener = await webdriver.findElement(

    await opener.click();
    await webdriver.findElement('[role="menu"] button');

    <p>Test authors frequently assume that their application's interface is
    updated immediately following user interaction. There are many factors that
    can violate this assumption. <a
    href="https://bocoup.com/blog/a-day-at-the-races">Unless developers are
    careful to verify the UI's response following every interaction, they will
    inadvertently create tests that fail erratically.</a></p>

    <p>ARIA and the APG specify details on how UIs should respond to user
    interaction. ARIA-aware WebDriver commands could make use of these details,
    pausing following interaction until the UI is updated as expected. As a
    result, developers would enjoy more predictable tests.</p>

  <p>Improved test resiliency</p>

    const closeBtn = await webdriver.findElement(

  </code></pre>

  <pre class="fragment"><code>webdriver.closeModal();</code></pre>

  <aside class="notes">
    <p>It's all too easy for developers to write brittle tests. When writing in
    terms of DOM elements, less experienced testers will use a "whatever works"
    strategy to get a test running.</p>

    <p>Code like this depends on implementation details that are subject to
    change with any refactoring. Maintaining that is a tiresome distraction for
    many developers.</p>

    <p>An application's accessibility tree is far more stable. Tests written
    against the accessibility tree are naturally more resilient. The widgets
    defined in the APG specify even more stable structure.</p>

    <p>This isn't to say tests written like this won't need maintenance--if the
    modal is removed, the test will have to change--but they won't have
    developers chasing down new CSS selectors.</p>

    element.pushButton();
            ^ Error: Accessible name of toggle button
                     inappropriately changed following push
  </code></pre>

  <aside class="notes">
    <p>Just as end users don't need to know ARIA to use the widgets, developers
    won't need to know ARIA to use these commands. However, the commands can
    teach developers by reporting errors when the application under test
    violates some expectation.

    For push buttons, ARIA requires that the accessible name is not changed
    as a result of changing the state of a push button. This can be checked
    by the pushButton() command.</p>

  <h2>Discussion</h2>

  <p>Stale element references</p>
  <p>"Preferred input mode"</p>
  <p>Guideline stability</p>
  <p>Publication</p>

  <aside class="notes">
    <p>Stale element references can happen, this proposal doesn't change that.
    However, the existing WebDriver commands just do some interaction and then resolve.
    The `pushButton()` command does some interaction and then verifies accessible name,
    which assumes that the element reference is not stale. This is a new problem.</p>
    <p>Preferred input mode: only testing the assistive technology code path misses the mouse user code path.
    The new commands can test both code paths by running a test twice in the two different modes.</p>
    <p>Guidelines stability: The examples in APG might still change, which would require WebDriver commands
    that rely on them to also change. This could break existing tests.</p>
    <p>Publication: where should the spec live? WebDriver or APG?</li>
